# NottsMissingMaps
The repository for UoN group 25, working on IBM's Missing Maps project.

## The Goal:
To produce a web app that takes arial photography and produces traces that show areas of human habitation as well as a report allowing you to view confidence scores and further breakdowns.

[Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/ "Missing Maps homepage") is an open and collabrative project to map unmapped areas of the world providing vital assistance to humanitarian organisations working in the affected areas. We are proud to be working with IBM to help this cause and anyone can get involved by joining in through their website. Our automated tool aims to assist with "Stage 1" of the process, where areas of potential habitation are traced by humans working remotely so volunteers on the ground then know what areas to investigate and add local detail.

## The Tools:
This project is being put together with the help of IBM Watson, by training an image classifier to help identify habitation. Buildings, roads etc.
The web app will be powered by vue.js to produce a responsive and slick user experience and we will provide more information about the back-end here as and when these features get added.

## Our Team:
We are a group of students from the University of Nottingham, currently studying in the UK but including representatives from the University's Ningbo campus in China. We each bring our own talents to the team, and our agile kaban process lets us take on tasks to suit our skills and as they become available, but we also take on our own responsibilities within the team:

- [Tom Dudley](https://github.com/Carbsta), team leader and git-master.
- [Yi Ding](https://github.com/DDEle), team admin.
- [James Abbott](https://github.com/psyja4), lead front-end dev.
- [Peter Hare](https://github.com/pete234), lead data scientist.
- [Sen Lin](https://github.com/SenLin0710), data scientist and developer.
- [Luke Ellis](https://github.com/Luke551), blog-master and front-end dev.

## Our Blog (coming soon):
As part of our work with IBM we are writing about our experience developing this webapp, and delivering that experience through blog posts written by all of us.
We are busy in the process of building this blog space and are looking forward to bringing you more information about our journey soon!

## Our Workflow:
We are producing this app in an agile way using the kaban methodology, we have a [trello board](http://bit.ly/2yU7jBK "Our Trello") where you can see tasks as they move through the development pipeline as well as using the [feature-branch git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow "Atlassian feature branch workflow tutorial").
Our Master branch corresponds to stable releases and code, so currently looks a little bare, but we have various development branches where features are being developed before being merged once they are done, tested and reviewed through pull requests.
