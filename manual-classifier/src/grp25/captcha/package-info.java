 * The main package for the manual classifier, which helps train classifiers.
 *
 * <p>
 *     This manual classifier is build with JavaFX. There are four classes in this
 *     package, including an entrance class {@link grp25.captcha.Main}, a data wrapper
 *     {@link grp25.captcha.ImgWithTag}, an app manager {@link grp25.captcha.ClassifierManager}
 *     and a UI controller {@link grp25.captcha.Controller}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     As for the functionally of this app, it can segment images into slices while
 *     attaching inhabitable/non-inhabitable tags to them in the same time. See our
 *     detailed instruction in our <a href="https://github.com/Carbsta/NottsMissingMaps/tree/master/manual-classifier">GitHub README</a>
